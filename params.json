SOFT\r\nfiles can be created and modified using basic text editor like vi or\r\nemacs and processed using common command-line Unix tools like grep or\r\ndiff.  SOFT supports representation of ontologies as triples similar\r\nto RDF and n3 formats.  Support for time-indexed relations is in the\r\ndevelopment.  In addition to triples, SOFT supports storing of entity\r\nproperties in CSV format or relational database.\r\n\r\nSOFT ontologies can be rendered as diagrams using Graphviz layout\r\nengine (http://graphviz.org) with support for advanced styles.\r\nCurrently software support for SOFT is implemented as perl module\r\nSOFT.pm.  Such functionality as parsing, validating, and writing of\r\nthe SOFT and its associated files is available.  Also ontologies in\r\nSOFT format can be converted into Graphviz gv files for diagram\r\nrendering or into plain text for use in other programs.\r\n\r\n## SOFT Specification in 5 Lines\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Simple Ontology FormaT (*.soft)\r\n#\r\n# [section]\r\n# [[subsection]]\r\n# entity_type:enity_name -relation_name-> entity_type:enity_name \r\n```\r\n## SOFT Example \r\n```\r\n\r\n# this is a comment (ignored)\r\n    \r\n[Healthy_Food]\r\ncat:apples -subcat-> cat:fruits\r\ncat:oranges -subcat-> cat:fruits\r\n```\r\nand it renders in\r\n\r\n![SOFT Example 1](SOFT/wiki/example1.png)\r\n\r\n","google":""}
